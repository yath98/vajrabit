                </h1>
                <p class="badtext">From families contesting buoyant games in their backyard to athletes training round-the-clock for years to land that perfect drop, this splendid sport has captured the emotions and dedications of thousands who have desired and deserved and has given back inspirations, jubilation and an exhibition worthy of great praise. A concept that had been around for ages was finally developed in British India into what became one of the most fascinating sports to be played in the world. A court hosting a Badminton round encompasses the thrill of war and the craft of art, leaving the spectators always on the edge of their seats, their hearts thumping with every crisp pop the sixteen feathered bird makes with the racket. <br />
The sweat dripping as the warriors with stringed swords slice the birdie leaping all over the court with astounding agility, the surge of energy as they fall and get up in a flash, the jumps, the landings, the spinning of racket after a score, the delicate serve, the skilled drive, the precise drop, the powerful smash, altogether the graceful flow of Badminton is a magic to behold. <br />

                <p class="crictext">The game of the gentlemen, the game that has defined India's sporting culture for decades, and a sport of paramount importance, cricket, in India, is no less than a religion. In a country of diverse cultures like ours, it would be unfathomable to think that a mere sport would be a convincing criterion of mass unification. But inexplicably, and undeniably, the truth itself emphasizes the impact cricket has on each and every one of us in this great nation. The simple sport of 11 a side played with a bat and a ball is the epitome of exuberance, elation, drama, and according to results, satisfaction, or deep despair. The Chetan Devraj Memorial cricket tournament is a reflection of all these emotions packed into a thrilling competition as eminent teams from around the country participate to win the coveted trophy. With the home team BIT Mesra set to defend their crown, it will be interesting to see who challenges them this time around.<br />

                <p class="bastext">Few sports in the world can boast of being as complete as basketball and even fewer can generate as much wonderment in such a brief amount of time. The playful dribbles that leave opponents flabbergasted as you balance the orange sphere of excellence in your hands and swivel through the trickiest of openings, the scintillating team plays that begin in our own half and tear through your rival&rsquo;s defence as a tactfully crafted move results in a lucid yet unplayable movement across the length of the court, the powerful shots that emerge unexpectedly from the farthest of ranges and leave adversaries dazed, the cleverly anticipated blocks that you dish out to prematurely terminate your counterpart&rsquo;s pass, and the most exquisite of dunks as you leap into the air to slam the ball through the ring &ndash; nothing quite compares to this rollercoaster of a game that never fails to enthral the crowds. Played both in men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s categories, the 2016 edition saw St. Xavier&rsquo;s emerge victorious in both categories while the 2017 edition saw St. Xavier&rsquo;s repeat their antics in the men&rsquo;s category while St. Columbus picked up the coveted trophy in the women&rsquo;s category.<br />

                <p class="footext">Football-the most popular sport commenced as war sans the bloodshed, it was the sophisticated modus operandi to flaunt supremacy, it was what changed the world. For most athletes, football is often how people lay out a path for their lives, filled with emotional highs and the lowest of lows. For some, it is an evanescent escape from the real world. For others, football is their whole world. Played on a rectangular field enclosed by white lines, it is a sport that takes us into uncharted territories of passion, emotion and real-world drama. Football is unquestionably more than mere physicality. It is a complex amalgamation of spontaneous thought process and having the physical ability to convert it into action. In the midst of unforgiving pressure, unreal expectations, and exceptionally high stakes, there is one single moment of brilliance that turns the game on its head which takes years of practice to turn into an overnight success. But then at the end, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no better feeling in the world than seeing the ball in the back of the net.&rdquo; XISS emerged as the winners of Vajra'16 while the Vajra'17 witnessed BIT Deogarh bagging the first position followed by NIT Jamshedpur.<br />

                <p class="chesstext">Dubbed as The King's Game, Chess is one of the most exhilarating forms of sports which excites the grey cells and satiates the strategist in everyone. Bordering upon abstract strategy, extreme focus and expertise in tactics, chess has always been a favourite among intellectuals and the mind-challengers. A nerve-racking battle of wits with the ultimate objective to checkmate the opponent- Chess is truly for the elite. Foresightedness aids in controlling the 16 pieces under a player and confidence propels these pieces around the 64 squares in order to capture the opponent's king. You make or break the game on your own - no one can be blamed for your shortcomings and no one can take credit for your triumph. Lapse of concentration for one moment can prove to be your downfall while brilliance can strike at the spur of a moment and can make you the victor ludorum. Nilesh of NIT Jamshedpur and Mohneesh of BIT Mesra proved their dexterity by bagging the first and second positions respectively in Vajra' 17 last November.<br />

The smashes, the serves, the spikes and the dives- getting everything perfect is the key to this sport. Volleyball requires the best concoction of astute tactics and crafty skills from the players. The three crucial touches to get the ball back in the opponent's court often behests the players to be unorthodox, providing a spectacle for those in the stands. Teamwork, passion and dedication would all be on display when the teams face off against each other. There will not be time to blink, there will not be a moment to keep calm but more importantly, there will not be a chance to give up hope- a sport that has witnessed astounding comebacks can never fail to amaze you. With NIFFT (2016), BIT Mesra (2017-Men's) and SSLNT (2017-Women's) proving their mettle in this sport in the previous editions, VAJRA'18 awaits its new champions.<br />
